# This is my site
This site currently serves two purposes.

1. A portfolio I can show people
2. Something I can continuously experiment on
	* Since this is a fairly minimal portfolio (sites should be minimal and the content should justify itself. I hate needless flashy animations) , it’s relatively easy to practice different things I’m learning. 
### With that said, here are the things I’ve implemented since my first draft! 
1. Implemented HTML5 Semantic Markup (rather then just divs)
2. Added a Easter Egg Geocites parody
	* Which was an experiment on how *not* to design a webpage
3. Implemented WCAG compatibility.
	* *As far as I am aware*,  I should pass an audit. However I cannot afford to actually spend one. Despite this, I’m continually testing the site based on the guidelines here: https://moritzgiessmann.de/accessibility-cheatsheet/
  
#### I'm happy to say this means I get good automated scoring:

I’ll do something else soon!
