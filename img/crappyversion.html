</h2>
<p>So theres this HILARIOUS new thing called a copypasta, that originated on something called 4chan. I sure the hope doesent become super toxic!</p>
<h3>
  <a href="https://acrose99.github.io/NavySealCopyPasta/">Theres one copypasta called the Navy Seal Copypasta which is really popular! I made a site where you can make your own!</a>
</h3>
<p>WARNING: ONLY FOR ADULTS LIKE ME</p>
<p>Theres also a site called Reddit thats like a cooler 4chan. BUT I CAN NEVER TELL HOW OLD THEY ARE</p>
<h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/acrose99/Reddit-Scraper">Thats why me and my cool friends used something called machine learning to predict the age of a Reddit commenter</a>
